Open the arrhythmia.m -file using MATLAB.
Make sure the measurement file you want to open is in the same directory as the arrhythmia.m -file.

Edit the line 6 to match your measurement file:
e.g.The line below opens the file "207.txt"
Data = load('207.txt')

Then press "RUN" in MATLAB.
If MATLAB asks something, press "Add to path".

Then you should see the results :)
